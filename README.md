## Development tips

- Tailwind classes are used across components. Use the class names in `src/` when tweaking layout.
- Run the dev server, make changes, save â€” Vite updates instantly.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature`
3. Make changes and push
4. Open a PR and describe the change briefly

If you want help with design or adding tests, open an issue and describe what you need.

## Notes & next steps

- I removed the Locomotive Scroll integration (smooth-scrolling) and debug components to restore native scrolling behavior.
- If you want the smooth-scroll behavior re-added later, I can re-integrate a lightweight, optional provider and styles.
